*DESCRIPTION: This **Interactive Quiz Application** is a web-based quiz game that helps users test their HTML knowledge. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it presents multiple-choice questions with four answer options. Users select an answer, and immediately receive feedback indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect. After each question, they can proceed to the next one by clicking a "Next Question" button. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, showing how many correct answers were given out of the total questions. The app has a clean and visually appealing design with hover effects on options and a background image. The JavaScript handles all the quiz logic, including loading questions, updating the score, and navigating through the quiz. This application is an interactive way to learn and review HTML concepts while providing instant feedback and an engaging experience.
